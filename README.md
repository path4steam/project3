eCommerce Project
=================

Started on July 24th

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a simple eCommerce framework.
The user should be able to register, login, post items to sell, view items posted by others, add items to their cart, view their cart, and when they are done, checkout and pay for them.
All posts are submitted by users.
You can view posts even without logging in, but to comment or add to cart, registration is required.
